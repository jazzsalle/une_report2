# Implementation Changelog

## Unreleased

- CC-001 (2026-07-30): pnpm monorepo bootstrap. Workspaces: apps/web,
  apps/field-web (React 19 + Vite 7), services/api (NestJS 11, /health),
  services/worker (NestJS standalone heartbeat), services/hwpx-engine
  (contract stub only - rhwp intake gated by ADR-15/CC-140), packages/domain
  (branded IDs, IdempotencyKey), packages/provider-adapters (boundary stub).
  Root: pnpm-workspace.yaml, shared tsconfig/ESLint flat/Prettier, README.
  Non-secret .env.example per service/app. scripts/validate_handoff.py now
  skips node_modules/.git/dist. database/migrations README corrected: V001-V010
  are the design-baseline schema, applied at CC-004. Gates: build/typecheck/
  test (10)/lint/validate_handoff all pass.
  Review fixes (architecture-guardian CONDITIONAL PASS, qa-gate-reviewer PASS
  WITH CONDITIONS; all Medium items closed same day): /api/v1 global prefix
  with /health excluded as out-of-contract ops endpoint (OpenAPI local server
  synced to :3001 in the same change); packages/domain switched to
  platform-neutral globalThis.crypto (browser-shareable per ADR-19); test
  sources now typechecked via per-package tsconfig.test.json; GitHub Actions
  CI added (.github/workflows/ci.yml - install/build/typecheck/test/lint/
  format:check/validate); prettier format + format:check scripts; Windows-safe
  watch scripts replace POSIX '&' pattern; unused @une/domain deps removed
  from provider-adapters/hwpx-engine; Node floor 22.12+ documented in
  TECHNOLOGY_PROFILE (Vite 7 requirement). Bootstrap exception: CC-000/CC-001
  committed directly to main; feature/CC-<id> branch policy applies from
  CC-002.

- CC-000 (2026-07-30): implementation profile approved. Backend NestJS
  (Node/TS) per ADR-19 (supersedes ASP.NET Core 8 recommendation), pnpm,
  MinIO/S3-compatible storage, GitHub Actions CI, Chrome+Edge latest,
  Windows 11 QA. Deployment: local Docker Compose (free path); demos need
  public URLs (no fixed IPs) → frontend Vercel + cloud container backend,
  host OPEN as OB-14. Hancom Track B version stays OPEN as OB-08.
  Reviewed by architecture-guardian and qa-gate-reviewer (parallel);
  all High/Medium findings fixed same day: IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE §6 synced
  to approved profile, session handoff updated, demo access-control and
  mock-jwt constraints added, branch policy recorded, ADR register created,
  ADR-19 citation/supersede-scope corrected (rhwp stays Rust/WASM per ADR-15).
